# Common
This repository contains common infrastructure code that I have used in many of my own projects. The different areas where they are used are divided by folder.

The AngularJS folder contains common services, directives, etc. that I have used in AngularJS.

The Tests folder has modules that I use to assist in unit testing. Most of these are for [Autofixture](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture). 

The Web folder contains modules for use with Asp.Net Web Api 2, Web Forms, etc.
